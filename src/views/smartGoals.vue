  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMART Goal #1: Become more proficient in programming&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is significant because I need to become more programing for when it is my job.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is measurable because it can be measured in the speed that it takes for me to complete a task.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is attainable because it is just an improvement on my current skills.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is relevant because programming is cool and is a good career path</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is trackable because Justin has access to my git&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMART Goal #2: Finish a math course for each semester</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is specific because who else wants to finish a math course each quarter</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is measurable because Aleks has a counter to see how far you are in the course</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is achievable because I have done this before</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is realistic because I have finished a course each semester last year</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is time-bound because I want to get two courses of math done before the end of this year</span></p>
